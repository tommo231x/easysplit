Homepage – About EasySplit section

About EasySplit
EasySplit makes it easier to split the bill when you go out to eat or drink.
It helps you keep track as you go, so there’s no awkward maths or arguments at the end.
You can share a live link so others join in, or just use it yourself and add names manually — everyone doesn’t have to be involved.
There’s no app to download and no account to create, so it’s quick to start and easy to use.
EasySplit runs entirely in the browser on any modern phone or computer.

That is the final agreed description.
No changes. No additions.

Footer – Creator credit + social link

Displayed at the very bottom of the page:

Directly underneath that line, add one subtle social link only:

@finafeels

Behaviour:

https://www.instagram.com/finafeels/

No TikTok

No extra text

No explanations

No bios

✅ FINAL REPLIT PROMPT (PASTE THIS)

Add a small “About EasySplit” section to the homepage below the main app UI and above the footer, using the following copy exactly as written:

The section must visually match the existing design:

subtle and unobtrusive

smaller font than the main app UI

muted / secondary text colour

constrained max width

responsive (mobile-first)

Do not add cards, borders, backgrounds, buttons, or calls to action.

At the very bottom of the page, add a subtle footer credit that reads exactly:

Directly beneath this line, add a single subtle social link:

@finafeels

The @finafeels text should hyperlink to:
https://www.instagram.com/finafeels/

Do not add any other social links, bios, or explanations.
