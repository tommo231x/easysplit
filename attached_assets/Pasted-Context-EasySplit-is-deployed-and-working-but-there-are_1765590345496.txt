Context: EasySplit is deployed and working, but there are mobile UX glitches that make the app feel broken. Fix the issues below and test on mobile (Chrome + Safari if possible), focusing on touch input and bottom-sheet / drawer behaviour.

1) “Create live session” feels delayed / doesn’t create link immediately

Bug: When the user taps Create Live Session (or “Go Live”), the live session + shareable link is not created immediately. It only appears/updates after the user performs another action (e.g., adds a name or adds a meal/item).
Expected: The live session should be created instantly on button press, and the UI should immediately show the share link / session state (loading → success), without requiring any further user actions.

Fix goals:

On click, call the session creation logic immediately.

Show a loading state while creating.

Once created, render the link instantly and copy/share button should work immediately.

Ensure state updates (React state / store) trigger a re-render right away.

2) Bottom sheet / slide-up input panel scroll + focus instability

Bug: The slide-up menu / bottom sheet that contains the inputs sometimes forces the user to scroll to see fields/buttons, and sometimes “flips out” / collapses / returns the user to the main screen unexpectedly while they’re interacting.
Expected: Bottom sheet should stay open and stable while user is entering data. Inputs and primary buttons should remain visible without awkward scrolling or sudden dismissal.

Fix goals:

Make the bottom sheet height responsive to viewport (especially with keyboard open).

Prevent accidental close from scroll/touch events unless user intentionally dismisses.

Keep focused input visible (auto-scroll into view).

Ensure content inside the sheet scrolls, not the page behind it.

3) Numeric price input jumps focus back to item name after each digit

Bug: On mobile, when adding an item (e.g., name “pizza”), entering price is broken: typing 4 jumps focus back to the item name field; tapping price again and typing 0 jumps back again. So entering “40” becomes impossible/annoying.
Expected: When the price field is focused, it should keep focus until the user changes it. Typing multiple digits should be smooth.

Likely cause / direction:

A re-render is forcing focus back to the first input (or the inputs are controlled in a way that resets focus).

Possibly autoFocus is being triggered repeatedly, or an effect runs on state change and focuses the name input.

Could also be caused by the component remounting (key changes) on each keystroke.

Fix goals:

Ensure price input component does not remount on each keystroke.

Remove any repeated autoFocus on name input after initial open.

Avoid changing key props tied to input value/state.

Preserve focus and caret position in the price input.

Deliverable

Fix all three issues.

Test the full flow on mobile:

Open app → tap “Create Live Session” → link appears immediately.

Open “Add Item” → bottom sheet stays open and stable.

Type item name + price 40 smoothly without focus jumping.

Keep styling consistent with current UI.
