These issues were discovered during a full stress test with 6 people and multiple menu items.

✅ WHAT WORKS (Do NOT change these)

Homepage loads cleanly with working actions (“Create / Upload Menu,” “Split a Bill,” “My Splits”).

Adding many items & people works without errors.

Assigning items works.

Calculating totals works.

Saving a split generates a valid link.

Opening the share link loads correctly.

Editing contributions from the shared view works.

Toast notifications (“Split saved!”, “Split updated!”) work properly.

⚠️ ISSUES TO FIX
1. Totals briefly show old values after saving

On the results page (after saving changes), the Grand Total sometimes shows the previous value until the user scrolls.

This is a UI refresh issue — likely the component isn’t re-rendering immediately after save.

Required change:

Ensure recalculation + rerender happens instantly after changes are saved.

Investigate state sync between EditContributions → ResultsView.

2. Accidental clicks on “Calculate Split”

In the Assign Items screen, the “Calculate Split” button sits directly at the bottom.

When the list is long, mis-clicks on “+” or scrolling can accidentally hit this button.

Required change:

Add spacing or reposition the button.

Alternatively stick the button to the bottom as a floating action button.

3. Edit Contributions → Save UX issues

Editing contributions for multiple people requires heavy scrolling.

The Save button is at the very bottom, forcing the user to scroll through all 6 person cards.

Required change:

Implement a sticky Save button (fixed bottom).

Or add a “Save” button at the top and bottom.

Optional: Add a compact list view or collapsible person cards.

4. Confusing “Make Changes” → “Add Yours” behaviour

On reopening a saved split, “Make Changes” disappears and is replaced by “Add Yours.”

This looks like a different action, but both open the edit mode.

Required change:

Unify the label: always show “Edit Split”.

“Add Yours” should only appear if the user is adding themselves, not editing existing data.

Ensure labels reflect the correct action.

5. Service charge cannot be changed from the results screen

Users can’t modify service percentage without going all the way back through the flow.

Required change:

Add “Edit service charge” button on the results page.

Or show a small inline editable field.

🎯 Overall Goal for Agent

Implement the fixes above, cleanly and minimally, without breaking the existing flows that already work correctly.

Keep the code modular, readable, and consistent with the project’s current structure.

If you understand, begin by:

Summarising what needs to be changed in the codebase.

Identifying which files/components must be edited.

Then start implementing fixes one by one.
