You are working on the EasySplit web app (https://easysplit.link
).

Your job now is to:

Fix UX / logic issues found in the latest 6-person stress test.

Make the experience equally solid on mobile (small screens / touch).

Do NOT break existing working flows.

Do not just refactor for style. Every change must be tied to a concrete UX / logic issue below.

✅ Things that already work (do NOT regress)

Keep these behaviours intact:

Homepage loads fast and clean with clear actions (“Create / Upload Menu”, “Split a Bill”, “My Splits”).

Creating a new split with Add Manually works for many items + people.

Assigning items with the + / - controls works, even with rapid clicks.

“Calculate Split” produces correct subtotals + service (12.5%) + grand total.

“Save Split” creates a working share link; opening it loads the split correctly.

From the share link, “Add Yours” lets a new person join and edit their items.

Multiple new people (e.g. Liam, Mona, Noah) can join and:

Add/change quantities

Correct mistakes (typos, wrong quantity)

Save and have their totals reflected in the main view

Toasts like “Split saved!”, “Split updated!” appear at the right times.

With 6 people, final view shows everyone with correct totals and a correct grand total.

Preserve these flows and retest them after making changes.

⚠️ Issues to fix (Desktop and Mobile)
1. Grand Total / cards sometimes show stale values after save

After saving edits in Edit Contributions, the grand total on the main Bill Split view sometimes still shows the old value until the user scrolls.

Same with some cards briefly showing old totals.

Required changes:

Fix the state / re-render logic so that all totals update immediately after a successful save, without relying on scroll.

Ensure this works on desktop and mobile (small screens, touch scroll).

2. “Calculate Split” easy to mis-tap at bottom of long list

On the Assign Items step, with many rows, the “Calculate Split” button sits directly under the scrollable list.

On desktop it’s easy to mis-click; on mobile it will be even easier to mis-tap while scrolling.

Required changes:

Make it harder to accidentally trigger:

Either convert it into a sticky/floating bottom button that stays clearly separated from the scroll area,

Or add extra spacing / safe area so a scroll flick doesn’t hit the button.

Verify this is comfortable on mobile viewport (e.g. 375×812) with touch behaviour.

3. Edit Contributions is tiring with many people (especially on mobile)

In Edit Contributions, each person’s card is tall; the Save button is far at the bottom.

With 6 people, you have to scroll a lot to review and then scroll all the way down to save.

On mobile this will feel even more painful.

Required changes:

Add a sticky Save bar at the bottom of the viewport (desktop + mobile), or

Provide a Save button that is always visible (e.g. fixed bottom action bar).

Make sure it’s clear when changes are saving and when they’re done (Saving... → enabled).

Confirm it feels okay on mobile: big enough tap target, not overlapping inputs when keyboard is open.

4. “Add Yours” vs “Edit Contributions” text & flow

On the shared page, the wording can be confusing:

“Add Yours” doubles as the entry point to full edit mode.

After you’re already in the split, it becomes “Edit Contributions”, but the difference isn’t obvious.

Required changes:

Make the copy clearer and more intuitive. For example:

When not in the split yet: “Add Yourself to This Split”

When already in: “Edit Your Share” or “Edit Split”

Ensure the logic for when each label appears is correct and consistent.

Re-check on mobile: text should fit and be clearly tappable.

5. Mobile behaviour & layout audit (critical)

Most users will be on phones in a restaurant. You must test and adjust:

On a narrow mobile viewport (e.g. Chrome devtools 375×812 / 390×844):

Homepage:

Buttons readable and not cramped.

Create Split / Add Manually:

Items and price fields easy to tap.

“Add Item” button visible without weird overlaps.

People & Assign Items:

Names and + / - buttons big enough for thumbs.

Long lists scroll smoothly without accidental button taps.

Results & Share:

Person cards readable; totals easy to spot.

Shareable link + buttons (“Copy link”, “Share”) reachable and not tiny.

Edit Contributions:

Input fields not hidden under keyboard.

Sticky Save bar behaves well when keyboard opens/closes.

If you need to tweak spacing/stacking for small screens (responsive CSS, flex/column layouts, media queries), do so.

🔧 How to work

Identify relevant files/components (e.g. split creation flow, assignment screen, results screen, edit contributions page, shared view).

Implement minimal, focused changes that address the issues above.

Use the dev server in desktop and mobile views to verify:

Fresh split creation with 3 people.

Added 3 more via share link.

Edits with mistakes + corrections.

Totals & grand total always correct and up to date.

After changes, write a short summary in comments or notes:

Which issue(s) it fixes

Do not remove or drastically redesign working flows. Improve them just enough to be robust and intuitive on both desktop and mobile.
