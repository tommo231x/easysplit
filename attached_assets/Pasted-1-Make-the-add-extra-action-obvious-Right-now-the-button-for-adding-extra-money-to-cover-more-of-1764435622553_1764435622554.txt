1. Make the “add extra” action obvious

Right now the button for adding extra money to cover more of the bill is not obvious.

Change:

Rename this button to something clear, e.g.:

“Add Extra / Round Up”
or

“Add Extra to Cover More”

Choose a label that fits the layout and makes it obvious this is how you add more than your own share.

Make sure the button is easy to notice on mobile and desktop (no tiny, tucked-away link).

2. Add a helper note explaining what the button does

Next to or just above/below that button, add a short helper line like:

“If you want to pay a bit more to help cover the total, tap this button. Any extra you add will lower everyone else’s cost automatically.”

Key points:

It must be clear that:

they’re paying more,

this will reduce everyone else’s amounts, and

the app will recalculate that automatically.

Keep it friendly and not too wordy.

3. When extra money is added, show a clear note to everyone

When a user actually adds extra money and saves the split:

The backend already recalculates totals. We now need a visible note on the shared split for all viewers.

Add a small, friendly note somewhere near the totals / header, such as:

If you can attach it to a specific person (we know who added extra):

“[Name] added extra money to help cover the bill. Your amounts have been updated and are now lower.”

If you can’t reliably attach a name, use:

“Someone added extra money to help cover the bill. Your amounts have been updated and are now lower.”

Requirements:

This note must be visible to everyone viewing that split via the share link.

It should be non-intrusive (no blocking modal), but obvious enough that people understand why their totals changed.

It should be clear that:

the recalculation is already done,

their new share is lower because of that extra payment.

4. Sync behaviour and refresh

Use the existing sync behaviour:

Changes only become visible to others after the user presses Save.

The existing auto-refresh / polling (e.g. every 5 seconds on the view page) should pick up:

the new totals, and

the “added extra” note.

Do not push live updates on every keystroke.
We only want updates on save, so it doesn’t become chaotic if many people are editing.

5. Do not change the data model unless absolutely necessary

Prefer to implement this as:

UI labels,

helper text,

and a simple metadata field / flag (if needed) to store “extra added” and optionally “by whom”.

Do not introduce heavy refactors or complex new flows.

6. When finished, summarise

When you’re done, please summarise:

Which files you changed.

The final button label you chose and where it appears.

The exact helper text you used near the button.

The exact note text that appears after someone adds extra.

How this looks and behaves on mobile vs desktop.

A quick confirmation that:

the totals recalc after extra is added, and

all users viewing the shared split see the new note and new totals after the next refresh.
