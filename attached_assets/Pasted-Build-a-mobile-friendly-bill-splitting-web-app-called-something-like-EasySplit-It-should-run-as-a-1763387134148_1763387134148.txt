Build a mobile-friendly bill-splitting web app called something like “EasySplit”. It should run as a normal website but also feel good on a phone (responsive, app-like layout).

The app has two main flows:

Create / Upload Menu – for a restaurant or user to define a menu.

Split a Bill – for a group at a table to pick what they had and see how much each person pays.

Tech

Use Node.js + Express for the backend.

Use SQLite as the database (not Replit DB), with a simple schema for menus and menu_items. Put all DB access in a single helper module so it’s easy to swap to Cloudflare D1 or Postgres later.

Use HTML, CSS and vanilla JavaScript on the frontend. No heavy frameworks.

Make the UI mobile-first and responsive.

Core behaviour

Home page: show two big buttons – “Create / Upload Menu” and “Split a Bill”.

Create / Upload Menu mode:

Let the user paste a simple text menu (one item per line: “Item name, price”).

Parse it into { name, price } items and show them for quick editing.

Allow an optional menu/restaurant name.

Save the menu to SQLite and return a short menu code (e.g. 6 characters) that can be shared.

Provide a link like /menu/<code> and show the code clearly.

Split a Bill mode:

Option A: Enter a menu code and load items from the database.

Option B: Quickly add items manually for a one-off menu.

Allow users to add people by name and list them as chips/tags.

For each menu item, show each person with +/– controls to set how many they had. Store this in memory on the frontend (no need to save orders in the DB).

Calculation

Inputs for currency symbol (default “£”), service charge % (default 12.5) and extra tip % (default 0).

For each person:

Calculate a subtotal (sum of their items).

Add service and tip based on their subtotal (per-person share).

Show a final total per person rounded to 2 decimal places.

Also show the grand total for the whole table. Try to keep rounding consistent so the sum of all people’s totals is as close as possible to the bill total.

Results display

Show a clear list like: person name, subtotal, service, tip, final total.

Add a “Copy breakdown” button that copies a plain-text summary to the clipboard (good for WhatsApp/DMs).

UX & misc

Make the design simple, clean and easy to tap on mobile (bigger buttons, good spacing).

Use labels and sensible colours for accessibility.

Assume only menus are stored in the database; names and bill splits are kept only in the current browser session.

Organise the code cleanly so I can later move the backend and database to another host (like Cloudflare) without rewriting the whole app.
